# Billing

## Billing

Quickpod requires prepayment in form of credit to account before you can launch pods, the billing/metering is a continous process till the pod is destroyed. If the pod is running runtime and storage costs accrue but if the pod is stopped only storage costs accrue. Bandwidth is totally free and there are no charges for downloads or uploads.

We accept credit card payments through Stripe and crypto payments through Coinbase. Use the add credit button to purchase credits one-time. Use the auto-debt feature to have the system automatically top up your account using a saved credit card when it runs low.

**Negative Balances**

Quickpod does not automatically destroy your instance(s) and data once your balance reaches zero.

Whenever your balance reaches zero or below, your instances will be stopped automatically but not destroyed. That way the data is still available for you to copy off the instance. Since the data is still stored on the instance, you are still billed for storage on stopped instances even when your balance is negative.

**When the balance reaches negative $2 or below the pod is destroyed completely.**



**Update Frequency**

Balances are updated about once every 15 minutes.

**Credit Card Security**

Quickpod does not see, store or process your credit card numbers, they are passed directly to Stripe

#### Refunds <a href="#refunds" id="refunds"></a>

After spending credits, there are absolutely no refunds.

For unspent credits, contact us on the website chat to request a refund. In most cases we can refund unspent credits. Unfortunately Coinbase Commerce does not support refunds, so there are no refunds possible for credits purchased via Coinbase Commerce.

#### Pricing <a href="#pricing" id="pricing"></a>

There are separate prices and charges for:

* Active rental (GPU) (in $/hr)
* Storage costs (in $/GB/month or total $/hr)
* Bandwidth is free

You are charged the base active rental cost for every second your instance is in the active/connected state. You are charged the storage cost (which depends on the size of your storage allocation) for every single second your instance exists and is online (for all states other than offline). Stopping an instance does not avoid storage costs.

You are not charged active rental or storage costs for instances that are currently offline.

Contract duration is preset when you create an instance as per the hosts duration set, you are at liberty to terminate instance before that or continue till the expiry day. at expiry the instance will be stopped and can not be started again.
