It has two modes user and host, users get to see GPU and CPU Search, hosts have additional hosting section where they can view the machines they are hosting and make changes to their listings.

### GPU Search <a href="#gpu-search" id="gpu-search"></a>

This is the default page where users can browse for available GPU offers, you can think of an offer as a slice of the machine which is available and can be rented from this page. Before you can create PODs u will need to add credit and ideally set a ssh public key also to access the POD. We provide a webconnect also which can be used alternatively.
